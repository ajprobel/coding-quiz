- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

Upon pressing the button, the timer will start counting down, and the first question of the quiz appears. The quiz is in multiple-choice format; after reading the question, please select and click the answer that fits the question the best.

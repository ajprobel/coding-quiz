# JP's Coding Quiz

## Description

Coding assessments are a common practice in the world of programming; whether it be for school or applying to a job. To help my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs, and to help aspiring web developers, I've made a timed code assessment!

While there are a lot of coding assessments that feature interactive coding portions, this page is more of "Coding Quiz" with multiple-choice formatted questions. Be careful - be mindful of the timer!

While completing this project, I learned a lot about manipulating HTML elements through JavaScript. A lot of elements for the quiz aren't rendered on the page until specific parts; this was all done using DOM manipulation.

## Usage

To access the quiz, follow this [link](https://ajprobel.github.io/coding-quiz/)

Once on the page, you will be greeted with a simple site that has a message about the quiz, a timer (inactive), a link to view high scores (if available), and a button to start the quiz.

Upon pressing the button, the timer will start counting down, and the first question of the quiz appears. The quiz is in multiple-choice format; after reading the question, please select and click the answer that fits the question the best.

The quiz ends either when the timer runs out, or you complete all of the questions.

Enter your name and submit to have your name and score saved in local storage!

*coming soon* The "View High Score" button doesn't currently work. It will be fixed by the next iteration.
